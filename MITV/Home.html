<h1> Murder In The Valley </h1>

<p> A Stardew Valley themed Murder Mystery. </p>
</br>
<h3> Welcome </h3>
<p> Here in the valley, days take on a similar pattern. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Working Time: When you farm, forage, or fish</li>
  <li>Visiting Time: When you visit your neighbors</li>
  <li>Shipping Time: When you sell goods AND ship gifts to your fellow villagers</li>
  <li>J'ACCUSE Time: You have the opportunity to accuse one of the villagers of murdering your Grandap</li>
</ol>  


<h3> Working Time </h3>
<p> Each of the actions below costs ONE ENERGY. You start the day with FIVE ENERGY - use it wisely. </p> 

<h5><button onclick="random_item(tilling)">Till Soil and Plant</button><h5>
<p>Clear space on your farm and plant seeds to grow produce that you can gift or sell.</p>     

<h5><button onclick="random_item(farming)">Water Crops</button><h5>
<p> You should tend your crops each day if you want them to grow. If you miss a day, they won't die, but they won't mature either.</p>     
      
<h5><button onclick="random_item(fishes)">Go Fishing </button><h5>
<p> Fishing is a reliable way to earn some money. You don't catch something EVERY time but persistance will usually pay off. A few villagers like fish as gifts but most prefer flowers.</p>     

<h5><button onclick="random_item(rocks)">Go Mining </button><h5>
<p> Mining is a lot of work for hope of a rare reward – you have to sift through a lot of coal to find a diamond.</p>   
      
<h5><button onclick="random_item(stuff)">Go Foraging </button><h5>
<p> It’s been a vibrant summer and there are many flowers and berries to find. Foraging is a fairly reliable way to find things that most villagers enjoy as gifts. </p>
