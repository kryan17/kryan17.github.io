<h3> Welcome </h3>

<h3> Around Town </h3>
<h5><button onclick="random_item(farming)">Tend to your farm (max once per day)</button><h5>
<p> You should tend your crops each day if you want them to grow. If you miss a day, they won't die, but they won't mature either.</p>     
      
<h5><button onclick="random_item(fishes)">Go Fishing </button><h5>
<p> Fishing is a reliable way to earn some money. You don't catch something EVERY time but persistance will usually pay off. A few villagers like fish as gifts but most prefer flowers.</p>     

<h5><button onclick="random_item(rocks)">Go Mining </button><h5>
<p> Mining is a lot of work for hope of a rare reward – you have to sift through a lot of coal to find a diamond.</p>   
      
<h5><button onclick="random_item(stuff)">Go Foraging </button><h5>
<p> It’s been a vibrant summer and there are many flowers and berries to find. Foraging is a fairly reliable way to find things that most villagers enjoy as gifts. </p>
