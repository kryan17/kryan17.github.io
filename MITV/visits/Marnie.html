He wants to keep it quiet because he is afraid that if the townspeople knew about us, they might lose respect for him, because … what, because I’m hideous!?! I don’t know what his PROBLEM is! Your grandfather walked in on us in a… compromising position the other day. I don’t think Lewis would actually hurt anyone but do I even really know him? Oh gosh… </h5>
