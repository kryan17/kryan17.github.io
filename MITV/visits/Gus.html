      <h3> Where were you when Grandpa died? </h3> 
      <p>I spent all day in town that day. I was working at the bar all night with Emily. That night was a rowdy one, so I saw your Grandpa but he looked alive and well when he left the bar around 8pm. </p>
      
      <h3> Can you think of anyone who might have a motive to murder Grandpa? </h3>

         <h5> I happen to know your Grandpa and Linus got into an argument about Linus accidentally walking over some of your Grandfather’s crops while he was out berry picking. I’m sure it was an honest mistake but I think Linus was really spooked by the confrontation – you never know what folks will do when they feel like they’re backed into a corner. </h5>
