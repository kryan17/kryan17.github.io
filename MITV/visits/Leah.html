      <h3> Where were you when Grandpa died? </h3> 
      <p>I live just south of your farm so I’m almost always around- I passed by Clint that day during my afternoon walk, I had Elliott over for tea, I think I saw Abagail exploring later that day, and there were definitely some squirrels who looked like they could be plotting something… </p>
      
      <h3> Can you think of anyone who might have a motive to murder Grandpa? </h3>

         <h5> I know Abagail likes to roam around the woods and enjoy the nature out here. A few weeks ago, she started a small campfire that got out of control and damaged some of Grandpa’s crops. He wanted her to compensate him for the lost profit or else he’d tell her parents what she had been up to, but I don’t know if she would have been driven to murder by something like that… or would she? </h5>

         <h5> You take a look around Leah’s cabin and notice that in addition to some art supplies and modeling clay, there is a heavy mallet that is part of a chiseling set for sculptures. That could DEFINITELY cause some blunt force trauma. </h5>
