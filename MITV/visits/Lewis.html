      <h3> Where were you when Grandpa died? </h3> 
      <p>I visited the farm that day but I didn’t actually see your Grandpa. I was over there picking up Grandpa's daily drop off from his storage bin to sell overnight- I do it every day as this town’s loyal public servant! </p>
      
      <h3> Can you think of anyone who might have a motive to murder Grandpa? </h3>

         <h5> Well, I’m usually not one to gossip but I will let you know that Robin has approached me several times since Grandpa died about getting logging rights on the old farm. Apparently, it’s a treasure trove for a carpenter like her and she seems quite interested in getting her hands on it!</h5>
