      <h3> Where were you when Grandpa died? </h3> 
      <p>I wasn’t near the farm that day. I was working at the bar all night with Gus. That night was a rowdy one, so I saw your Grandpa but he looked alive and well when he left the bar around 8pm the day before we all found out he’d passed. </p>
      
      <h3> Can you think of anyone who might have a motive to murder Grandpa? </h3>

         <h5> I’d like to think the best of people but sometimes folks will start ranting after a few drinks. I know Willy has been holding a grudge against your Grandpa for the longest time, for the silliest reason! He is infatuated with Marnie and thinks she’s in some sort of secret relationship. Your Grandpa, Yorba rest his soul, was such a ladies’ man and so he assumed your Grandpa was his competition for Marnie’s love.</h5>
