      <h3> Where were you when Grandpa died? </h3> 
      <p>I was in the vicinity. I took a walk to clear my head after a rough night south of the farm: I passed Willy fishing. </p>
      
      <h3> Can you think of anyone who might have a motive to murder Grandpa? </h3>

         <h5> Not really. I got into a fight with Grandpa the night he died at the saloon – it turns out he might be my father and he thought I was wasting my potential. I got mad: really mad. He’s been absent my entire life and then wants to swoop in to complain about how I’m living my life? Heck no. But I took a walk to cool down and I’d never have murdered my dad right when I found him. </h5>
